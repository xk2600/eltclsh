eltclsh stands for ``editline tcl shell''. This is an interactive shell
for the TCL programming language. It provides command line editing,
history browsing as well as variables and command completion thanks to
editline features. The completion engine is programmable in a way similar
to tcsh, and comes with built in completion for the entire Tcl language
by default.

Similarly, elwish (editline windowing shell) is an interactive
interpreter for the Tk toolkit.


--- PREREQUISITES -------------------------------------------------------

You need the following tools installed on the system before you can
compile eltclsh:

- Tcl/Tk, any version from 8.0 to 8.6.

- editline library (a.k.a. libedit). The editline library provides
  generic line editing and history functions, similar to those found in
  sh(1). It is present by default on *BSD systems, but you probably need
  to install it if you run another system. You need a decently recent
  version, as eltclsh need some features that have been added by October
  2001. We maintain a packaged version of the library here:
  (<http://softs.laas.fr/openrobots/libs/editline.php>).

- The GNU make utility, version 3.79 or higher. eltclsh Makefiles use
  some GNU make extensions and thus won't work with other make
  implementations. Note the GNU make is the standard make on most Linux
  systems. (<http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>).


--- SUPPORTED PLATFORMS -------------------------------------------------

eltclsh is known to run on the following platforms:

- Sparc Solaris (tested on Solaris 2.5.1 through 9).
- ix86 Linux (tested on Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian)
- NetBSD 1.6 and later
- OpenBSD 3.2 and later


--- GETTING ELTCLSH -----------------------------------------------------

The lastest version is available from:
http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/soft/shell/eltclsh


--- INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS -------------------------------------------

eltclsh uses the GNU configure system to handle most of the system
dependencies configuration. So you can build and install it with the
following commands:

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure [options]
        make
        make install

Use './configure --help' to find out all the available configure
options. On some systems, --with-tcl=DIR and --with-tk=DIR may be
required to specify where to find tclConfig.sh (resp. tkConfig.h).
You might also need to use --with-includes and --with-libraries to
specify the path to editline headers and library, respectively.

The --prefix option (default: /usr/local) defines the base directory
of the installation.
